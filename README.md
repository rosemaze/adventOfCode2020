# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Coding Principles

- Establish the right types before implementing the soltuion
- Name stuff explicitly, clearly and consistently.
- Avoid using else, else if. Rather create one more constant, adopt early returns, enums + exhaustive checks.
